# Welcome to SayAgain
SayAgain is an innovative application designed to help you find closure by allowing you to have one last conversation with a loved one who has passed away. Using Google's Gemini, SayAgain lets you upload past chat histories, enabling the AI to simulate conversations in the style of the person you miss. It's a heartfelt way to say your final goodbyes and cherish the memories you shared.

## Purpose
I came to Canada alone at the age of 16. After studying hospitality, navigating various jobs, I eventually found my calling as a Health Care Aide. I've witnessed firsthand the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment. My work inspired me to create SayAgain, an app that leverages AI to offer comfort and closure to those grieving the loss of a loved one.

The purpose of SayAgain is to provide a comforting space for those in mourning. By utilizing AI, the app allows users to express their feelings, relive treasured memories, and find solace in simulated conversations. Itâ€™s a unique way to cope with grief and say the goodbyes that were left unsaid.

## Get started
To begin using SayAgain, simply visit [gari.one](https://sayagain.gari.one/) and follow the steps. Once the chat is submitted, you can start engaging in heartfelt conversations with your loved ones.

## Features
- Heartfelt Conversations: Engage in realistic and emotionally resonant conversations with your loved one, powered by Google Gemini's advanced AI.
- Personalized Experience: Gemini learns from your uploaded chat, adapting to the unique style of texting of your loved one.
- Secure and Private: Your data privacy is paramount. All chat histories are handled with the utmost security and deleted after processing.
- Emotional Support: Find solace and closure through simulated conversations that can help you process grief and express unspoken feelings.
- User-Friendly Interface: SayAgain is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to everyone.

## Safety
Your privacy and data security are our top priorities. SayAgain is designed to ensure that no files you submit are accessible to me or anyone else. Uploaded chat histories are temporarily stored in the application code solely for the purpose of being sent to the Google Gemini Service. Once this transfer is complete, the files are immediately deleted from our system.

Additionally, I have implemented a schedule to delete any saved files every day at 2 a.m. PST. This ensures that any residual data is promptly removed on a daily basis.
